# Week-8
# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: ![SQL Injection (SQLi)](https://github.com/kevinsinclair83/Week-8/blob/master/SQLiweek8.gif)

Vulnerability #2: ![Session Hijacking/Fixation](https://github.com/kevinsinclair83/Week-8/blob/master/SessionHijackingweek8.gif)


## Green

Vulnerability #1: ![Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://github.com/kevinsinclair83/Week-8/blob/master/XSSweek8.gif)

Vulnerability #2: User Enumeration ![User Enumeration](https://github.com/kevinsinclair83/Week-8/blob/master/userenum1.gif)


## Red

Vulnerability #1: ![Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://github.com/kevinsinclair83/Week-8/blob/master/CSRFweek8.gif)

Vulnerability #2: ![Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)](https://github.com/kevinsinclair83/Week-8/blob/master/IDOR.gif)

## Notes

These vulnerabilities were fairly intuitive to discover.
